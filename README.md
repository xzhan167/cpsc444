# RoomieDuty

RoomieDuty is a roomate management app for roommates to communicate and manage common household responsibilities by providing a shared space to set initial expectations, facilitate reminders, and resolve issues as they occur.Â While sharing living spaces is common for students and young professionals, many households struggle with recurring communication challenges such as chore delegation, noise management, or scheduling shared spaces. These issues may be due to differing expectations or negligence of responsibilities, and often remain unresolved until tensions build, leading to frustration or conflict among roommates. Our interface aims to prevent such conflicts through facilitating better communication to resolve issues before they lead to larger issues.
